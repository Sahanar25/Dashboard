##  Project Overview

This project involves the design and development of a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) sales, Average Price, Cars Sold metrics, and more. By visualizing this data, the dashboard helps stakeholders monitor sales performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions.

## Tools Used

1. Microsoft Power BI for data visualization

2. Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and preparation


### Problem Statement 1 : KPI's Requirement
The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to our sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.

Sales Overview:

Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales

Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Sales

Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales

Difference between YTD Sales and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) Sales

Average Price Analysis:

YTD Average Price

MTD Average Price

YOY Growth in Average Price

Difference between YTD Average Price and PTYD Average Price

Cars Sold Metrics:

YTD Cars Sold

MTD Cars Sold

YOY Growth in Cars Sold

Difference between YTD Cars Sold and PTYD Cars Sold

### Problem Statement 2 : Chart Requirements

1. YTD Sales Weekly Trend: Display a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales. The X-axis should represent weeks, and the Y-axis should show the total sales amount.

2. YTD Total Sales by Body Style: Visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart.

3. YTD Total Sales by Color: Present the contribution of various car colors to the YTD total sales through a pie chart.

4. YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region: Showcase the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a map chart to visualize the sales distribution geographically.

5. Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form: Provide a tabular grid that displays the sales trend for each company. The grid should showcase the company name along with their YTD sales figures.

6. Details Grid Showing All Car Sales Information: Create a detailed grid that presents all relevant information for each car sale, including car model, body style, colour, sales amount, dealer region, date, etc.

### Steps Followed

1. Data Gathering & Preparation:

Collected car sales data from the dealership, including sales figures, car details (model, body style, color), dealer regions, and dates.

Cleaned and transformed the raw data to make it suitable for analysis, ensuring no missing or inconsistent values in the dataset.

2. Defining the KPIs:

Identified the critical KPIs: YTD, MTD, YOY Growth for Total Sales, Average Price, and Cars Sold metrics.

Calculated the differences between current YTD figures and Previous Year-to-Date (PTYD) values for comparative analysis.

3. Dashboard Design & Layout:

Decided on the layout for presenting key insights, ensuring a balance between clarity and detail.

Used various visualization types like line charts, pie charts and grids to display the KPIs and other relevant sales information.

4. Visualizing Sales Performance:

YTD Sales Weekly Trend: Created a line chart to show the weekly progress of Year-to-Date (YTD) sales, with weeks on the X-axis and total sales on the Y-axis.

Sales by Body Style and Color: Developed pie charts to represent YTD total sales across different car body styles and colors.

Regional Sales Distribution: Implemented a map chart to display YTD sales data across various dealer regions.

5. Detailed Grids:

Created a tabular grid to display company-wise sales trends, showcasing the company name and their respective YTD sales figures.

Designed another detailed grid to list all car sales information, including model, body style, color, sales amount, dealer region, and date.

6. Interactivity & Insights:

Integrated interactive filters to allow users to drill down into specific regions, body styles, or time periods for deeper insights.

Enabled hover-over tooltips on charts to give additional details about sales trends and figures.

7. Testing:

Conducted testing to ensure all metrics were calculated correctly and the dashboard displayed accurate and real-time data.

## Project Summary

The Car Sales Dashboard developed using Power BI successfully provides dynamic and interactive insights into the car dealership's sales performance. By visualizing key metrics such as Year-to-Date (YTD) sales, Month-to-Date (MTD) sales, and Year-over-Year (YOY) growth, the dashboard enables the dealership to track progress, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

The ability to drill down into specific regions, car body styles, or time periods allows stakeholders to explore the data in greater detail, leading to more informed strategic planning. The dashboardâ€™s real-time nature ensures that users have access to the most up-to-date information, enhancing operational efficiency and responsiveness to market changes.
